# This JSON string is what you want to put in the 'Alert Name' of every alert you set.

# If you are running a PineScript strategy, then this is not needed, as long as the output of your strategy has the same template as this alert. 
Also you may want to change the limit orders to market orders, and change the stop loss and take profits to percentages rather than actual numbers.
