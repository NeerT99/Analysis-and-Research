# Analysis-and-Research

The Goal of this repository is to create a script that will automate my trading.

the getCMCdata script will:
  1. use the selenium library to access coinmarketcap
  2. print all the top winners and losers from the last 1h, 24hrs and 7d
 
The idea behind this is to use other sources of data (for example economic data such as CPI and NFP) to decide whether to long or short.
Then use the getCMCdata script to pick the top winners to long, and the top losers to short in order to maximise profits.
